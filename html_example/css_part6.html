    Hello! This is a generator for text fonts of the "cool" variety. I noticed people were trying to find a generator like fancy letters, but were ending up on actual font sites rather than generators of copy-paste text like this one. So currently this is basically a duplicate of the above, but I think I'll try to collect a few more "cool" text fonts, like the old enlgish one, and specialise this a bit.
